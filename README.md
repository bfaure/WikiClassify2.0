## Directory Structure
When first cloning the repo, run the init.cpp file to create the directory structure expected by the functions (not carried over by git). After this you can place your Wikipedia data dump file (.xml) in the data/sources/ directory. All use case outputs will reside in one of the sub-directories of the data/outputs/ location.
